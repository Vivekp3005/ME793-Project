Description:

This study investigated the mechanisms driving the fatigue life in as-built laser powder bed fusion Inconel 718 and the relationships among the high-cycle fatigue life, the surface roughness, and the additive manufacturing processing parameters. A total of 25 different sets of processing parameters were investigated (a detailed list can be found in the manuscript). The processing parameters that were varied were the laser power, the laser scan speed, the layer thickness, and the build orientation. The ranges of each parameter and the number of increments is shown below:

Laser power: range from 115 W to 465 W, with 11 values selected
Laser scan speed: range from 620 mm/s to 1770 mm/s, with 13 values selected
Layer thickness: 30 µm and 60 µm
Build orientation: 0°, 60°, and 90° relative to the recoater direction

Differences in the surface roughness, the high-cycle fatigue life, and fractography were measured. Two processing-parameter metrics were observed to dominate the high-cycle fatigue life: the build orientation and the laser-energy density. Build orientation affected the fatigue life due to the relationship between build orientation and surface roughness. For a given build orientation, the laser-energy density decreased the fatigue life due to sub-surface defects. Fractography analysis revealed that sub-surface defects consisted of lack-of-fusion pores at low laser-energy densities and secondary cracking and porosity at high laser-energy densities. Guidelines to improve fatigue life in as-build Inconel 718 manufactured using laser powder bed fusion were given.

Organization:

/SEM/Powder/IN718/
	Subfolders 1 and 2 relate to the two different samples of powder that was used in the L-PBF build. Folders contain BMP files, SIF files, and text documents for each respective image. Folders contain various images at different magnification levels to measure powder size and shape distributions.

/Surface Roughness/
	Subfolders consist of a ReadMe, an Excel worksheet that contains all of the surface roughness data, a folder named Images that contains the raw images collected, and a folder named Surface Roughness Tests that contains images of the profilometry software.
